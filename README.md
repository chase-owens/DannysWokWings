# Wings at Danny's Wok

While scrolling on LinkedIn, I came across a [post by Bruce Ratner](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6461938151840628736) that showed an interesting wing menu with 'no apparent rhyme or reason' as to how the price was determined.

## Solution

According to these calculations, the best price per wing price is $1.112 per wing and can be bought at this price buying 25, 50, or 125 wings.
